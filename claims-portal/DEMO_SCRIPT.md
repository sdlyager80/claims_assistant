## 📊 Act 3: The Results (2 minutes)

### Slide: Damage Assessment

**Show Side-by-Side Comparison**:

| 2024 Claim | 2026 Claim |
|------------|------------|
| No warning system | Storm alert 48 hours ahead |
| No water sensor | Sensor detected immediately |
| Discovered at 9 AM | Detected at 3:15 AM |
| 6+ hours of water damage | <2 hours before mitigation |
| $15,000 damage | **Could have been $50,000+** |

**Script**:
> "Look at the difference. The 2024 claim wasn't discovered until 9 AM when employees arrived. Water had been flowing for hours. The 2026 incident? Caught at 3:15 AM, stopped at 3:30 AM, professionals working by 5:30 AM."

---

### Slide: Current Loss Breakdown

**Show Damage Assessment**:
- **Inventory Loss**: $12,500 (flowers, plants, arrangements)
- **Structural**: $7,000 (flooring, drywall, shelving)
- **Business Interruption**: 3 days (Valentine's week)
- **Total**: ~$19,500

**Script**:
> "Even with the quick response, there's still damage. Flowers are perishable—once the cold air got in, some inventory was lost. Some flooring needs replacement. But..."

**Key Point**:
> "Our engineers estimate that without the water sensor, this would have been a $50,000+ claim with 2-3 weeks of business closure. That $300 water sensor saved over $30,000 in damages."

---

### Slide: AI Settlement Recommendation

**Show AI Insights Dashboard**:
- **Fraud Risk**: Low (8/100 score)
- **Settlement Range**: $18,000 - $22,000
- **Confidence**: 87%
- **Recommendation**: Approve

**Script**:
> "Our AI analyzed the entire claim. Fraud risk? Extremely low. The sensor verified the event. Sarah has a history of following our recommendations. She reported immediately. There's literally sensor logs showing the exact time water was detected."

**Show Fraud Analysis Factors**:
✅ Prior relationship established
✅ Sensor verification of event
✅ Rapid reporting and response
✅ Followed all prevention measures

---

### Slide: Customer Experience Timeline

**Show Customer Journey**:

| Time | Customer Experience |
|------|---------------------|

| 3:50 AM | Confirmation received (3 minutes) |

**Show Customer Sentiment**:
> "Customer Sentiment: Positive - Grateful for fast response and sensor system"

## 🎬 Act 4: The Bigger Picture (2 minutes)

### Slide: The Prevention Payoff

**Show ROI Calculation**:

| Investment | Annual Cost | Claim Prevention Value |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Water Sensor | $300 one-time | $30,000+ saved |
| Monitoring Program | 10% discount = -$325/year | Free with savings |
| Prevention Measures | ~$800 (insulation, etc.) | Ongoing protection |
| **Total Investment** | **~$775 net** | **$30,000+ saved** |

**Script**:
> "Here's the business case. Sarah invested about $1,100 total. She gets a $325 annual discount for the Smart Monitoring Program—so it pays for itself in 3-4 years even without a claim. But she had a claim, and the sensor prevented $30,000 in additional damage."

**Key Message**:
> "This isn't insurance that just pays for losses. This is insurance that actually prevents them."

But the AI handled all the routine analysis, freeing Jennifer to focus on what matters: helping Sarah get back to business."

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI fraud detection?**
> "In production, our AI fraud scoring is 96% accurate. It's trained on millions of claims. But importantly, it's not making decisions—it's providing insights for human adjusters. Jennifer still reviews everything."

**Q: What if the policyholder doesn't have a sensor?**
> "They still get excellent service. The sensor is just one fast-track criterion. There are other ways to qualify—good history, rapid reporting, weather events, etc. The sensor just provides additional verification."

**Q: How much does the sensor program cost?**
> "For the business: $300 sensor + $50/year monitoring. But they get a 10% policy discount, so it pays for itself. For us: ~$100 average cost per sensor through bulk purchasing, huge ROI in prevented losses."

**Q: Can this work for life insurance claims?**
> "The same principles apply. In life insurance, we have medical record verification, beneficiary verification, IRS validation—different data sources but same AI-powered fast-track approach."

**Q: What happens if the AI makes a mistake?**
> "Every fast-track claim is reviewed by a supervisor within 24 hours. If the AI approved something incorrectly, we catch it in post-approval audit. But our error rate is under 2%. And mistakes go both ways—we also catch claims that should have been fast-tracked but weren't."
